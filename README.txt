# My-project-for-EE511

This is a file for the projects I did in the course EE511-Simulation Methods for Stochastic System.

I try to learn Python, so all projects will be done in Spyder(Python 3.5).

If you have any advise for my projects, feel free to contact me via this address: llh455398472@gmail.com

Thanks!
