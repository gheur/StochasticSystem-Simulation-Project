# Projects-for-EE 511

Here are 5 projects I did in the course EE 511-Simulation Methods for Stochastic System. These programs involved many contents about simulation and statistics. All of them were done with Spyder(Python 3.5).

## Introduction

 - [**Project 1**][Project 1] </br>
   Bernoulli trials, Sampling, Bootstrap 
 - [**Project 2**][Project 2] </br>
   Inverse CDF Method, Networking
 - [**Project 3**][Project 3] </br>
   K-means clustering and mixture distribution 
 - [**Project 4**][Project 4] </br>
   Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Noise in GMM
 - [**Project 5**][Project 5] </br>
   Monte Carlo, Variance Reduction Methods for Monte Carlo, Simulated Anealing algorithm
